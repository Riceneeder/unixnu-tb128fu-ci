## 存储与根卷 {#storage}

`device-verified`

组件: `ShengUfs`, `VerifiedRoot`, `VirtioMmioBlock`, `RamBlock`.

### 硬件与依赖

- UFS 3.1 host on SM8250, bound through ShengUfs, plus the two authenticated volume windows \(OS and SystemOS\) inside userdata.
- The Data seed is a raw APFS container: scripts/prepare-owner-data-fixture.py requires NXSB at 0x20, so the ADT reserves RAMDisk rather than PackedRAMDisk.

### 配置

- CONFIG\_XNU\_NATIVE\_UFS=y, CONFIG\_XNU\_VERIFIED\_ROOT\_PROBE=y, CONFIG\_XNU\_OWNER\_ROOT\_AUDIT=y, CONFIG\_XNU\_OWNER\_ROOT\_TRUST=y.
- CONFIG\_XNU\_NATIVE\_RAM\_BLOCK=y and CONFIG\_XNU\_OWNER\_DATA\_MOUNT=y; the Data mount must go through the RamBlock IOKit device, not /dev/md0.

### 操作步骤

- ./unixnu build payload --data-ramdisk &lt;seed&gt;, then bootimg, then fastboot flash boot\_b.
- The panel reports UFS read progress and the RAMDisk capacity; the USB console carries exit records.

### 开发经验

- UFS reads run through ShengUfs and the panel reports verified blocks; the root is published only with an owner-signed policy, so CONFIG\_XNU\_VERIFIED\_ROOT\_PROBE must stay on or IOFindBSDRoot times out ten times and panics.
- The Data mount fails with ENOENT through /dev/md0 \(measured 2026-10-26, panic screen offline scratch Data mount failed: 2\); publishing the seed through RamBlock as a real IOMedia is the path that mounts.
- The Data volume is 32 MiB and holds the original private/var excluding staged\_system\_apps \(39 files, 611715 bytes\). Measured 2026-10-27: 20000 directories fit in 5.8 MiB, so capacity and inodes are not the limit for the services that fail.
- cryptexd aborts with mkdirat \[28: No space left on device\] while that volume reports 31 MiB free, so the ENOSPC names a different mount than /private/var.

### 完成条件

- The configured OS volume mounts and launchd starts; the Data volume mounts read-write as apfs and is accepted by native\_owner\_data\_prepare.
- Persistence within the allocated Data region is not yet demonstrated across a reboot.

### 当前范围

- The write that fails with ENOSPC is not yet identified: the mkdir probe that prints its path is built but has not run on hardware.
- The Data seed cannot simply be enlarged: boot\_a and boot\_b are 192 MiB and the payload is a FAT volume, so a seed larger than that does not fit.

### 下一步

- Run the mkdir probe build and read the path it prints, then decide whether the failing write is on /private/var or elsewhere.

### 证据

- `device`: [The kernel reports cryptexd aborting with mkdirat ENOSPC while the Data volume reports 31 MiB free, which places the failing write on a mount other than /private/var.](https://github.com/FFT-infra/UniXNU-alioth/blob/695a35bd11337a27473a1ef6687977c0527b6878/docs/evidence/2026-10-27-boot-diagnostics.md)
  Command: <code>read /dev/tty.usbmodem&lt;N&gt; at 115200 8N1 and collect EXITLOG records</code>. Revision: `24d127c47217eb580dbe3f3a94c32ad25cbaae00`.

## 显示 {#display}

`implemented`

组件: `GopFramebuffer`.

### 硬件与依赖

- The panel is 1080x2400 and the loader hands over a framebuffer at 0x9c000000 with 4320-byte rows and 32 bpp, so the display path starts from that memory rather than from a GPU.
- IOMobileFramebufferLegacy is prelinked and exports nothing, so the board archive binds each name to its original absolute address.

### 配置

- CONFIG\_XNU\_NATIVE\_LEGACY\_DISPLAY=y; offline-component-load-probes.patch calls both display entry points, so the archive must resolve them or the link fails.
- build-xnu-4k-baseline.sh force-loads libNativeLegacyDisplay.late.a and re-proves every address against this kernel on each run.

### 操作步骤

- Boot the image and read the diagnostic page rows for DISPLAY stage, CLIENT and SWAP; the USB console carries the exit records.
- A photograph of the panel is the frame evidence until a swap is submitted.

### 开发经验

- Measured 2026-10-27 on boot-usb34: the lock screen is stable, SWAP calls=7 ok=7 rej=0, and backboardd creates its resources with kret=0. Earlier builds never submitted a frame at all.
- The panel is driven directly by the kernel's own renderer, which is why the boot-progress page and the colour bands are visible before any userspace renderer runs.

### 完成条件

- A known frame appears with correct geometry and colors, then userland presentation and backlight controls work.

### 当前范围

- No wallpaper: the lock screen draws its date and time over a black field, so composition reaches the text layer only. gpu offered=0 confirms the GPU stack takes no part.

### 下一步

- Get backboardd to start before investigating frame submission: with no render server there is no client that could call Swap.

### 证据

- `device`: [DISPLAY stage=10 with CLIENT calls=4 class=IOMobileFramebufferUserClient, and SWAP calls=0: a client connects but no frame is submitted.](https://github.com/FFT-infra/UniXNU-alioth/blob/695a35bd11337a27473a1ef6687977c0527b6878/docs/evidence/2026-10-27-boot-diagnostics.md)
  Command: <code>read the diagnostic page and the USB console after booting the image</code>. Revision: `24d127c47217eb580dbe3f3a94c32ad25cbaae00`.

## 诊断 {#diagnostics}

`device-verified`

组件: `QcomXnuUsbDebug`.

### 硬件与依赖

- The board's DWC3 controller, its apps SMMU stream, and the boot arguments qcom-usb-debug=1 and qcom-usb-ctl=1 in board.toml.
- The diagnostic page is boot-progress=2 with boot-diag-resume=10, so it returns after scanout stops.

### 配置

- board.toml selects the QcomXnuUsbDebug component and passes qcom-usb-debug=1 and qcom-usb-ctl=1.
- configs/alioth\_defconfig sets CONFIG\_XNU\_BOOT\_PROGRESS=y and CONFIG\_XNU\_QCOM\_USB\_DEBUG=y.
- The apps SMMU is iommu@15000000 with qcom,skip-init; the USB node's iommus = &lt;0x47 0x00 0x00&gt; gives SID 0.

### 操作步骤

- ./unixnu build kernel, then build payload and bootimg, then fastboot flash boot\_b.
- Read the console at /dev/tty.usbmodem&lt;N&gt; with a raw 115200 8N1 tty; the dock's SN234567892 node is not the phone.
- Control frames are SXNU1 &lt;16 hex session&gt; &lt;8 hex seq&gt; &lt;VERB&gt; &lt;8 hex crc32&gt;, HELLO first to learn the session.

### 开发经验

- The CDC-ACM console refused to start with error=10 core=0 domain=5. QcomUsbDomainInstall calls halted\(\) before scan\(\), so a PRTCAPDIR of 3 would have returned CoreRunning=4; it returned 5, which proves the controller already reported device mode.
- Firmware leaves an SMR entry for SID 0 pointing at context bank 5 with SCTLR=0xe0 \(M=0\) and TTBR0=0: the stream is programmed but no table exists under it. scan\(\) now reclaims that slot only when translation is off and there is no table, and still refuses a bank that holds a live mapping.
- With that, the console enumerates as 1209:316d named QcomXnuUsbDebug and the kernel log is readable on the host. It is the only channel that keeps a record after the panel has moved on.
- printf and kprintf both fail to reach the console: a DEVELOPMENT kernel leaves disable\_kprintf\_output true without -enable\_kprintf\_spam, and printf's console path did not reach the \_cnputs tee either. qcom\_usb\_debug\_write\(\) is the entry point that works.
- Exit records measured over 420 s: 180 xpcproxy exits with status=0 \(normal fork and exit\), 13 cryptexd SIGABRT with ns=18 code=2 \(OS\_REASON\_LIBSYSTEM\_CODE\_FAULT\), 11 liveactivitiesd SIGTRAP, 2 lsd SIGSEGV. Each process crashes at one fixed PC repeated, so the fault is deterministic rather than a race.
- A software REBOOT via the control channel is acknowledged \(state=queued\) but does not reach fastboot: the worker calls reboot\_kernel\(0, NULL\), an orderly restart that unmounts every filesystem and returns through UEFI. Entering fastboot needs the ABL IMEM handshake, whose address is not measured here.

### 完成条件

- The console enumerates and answers HELLO and STATUS on the board; STATUS reports usb=3 er=0.
- Every process exit and crash reaches the host console, which is what the exit-loop investigation needs.

### 当前范围

- cryptexd's fault is not yet attributed: OWNER\_CRYPTEX\_FILES is 0 by design because UNION\_SYSTEMOS requires it off, so cryptexd's expected paths do not exist. Its crash PC is captured but not symbolicated.
- The MAC exec refusal is intermittent. One boot showed backboardd, imagent, lockdownd, cfprefsd, sharingd and nfcd exiting with status=9 ns=9 code=8; the next showed none of them, so the errno the patch now reports has not been observed yet.
- Symbolication of the crash PCs against the extracted dyld shared cache was attempted and produced implausible image names, so it is not reported as a result.

### 下一步

- Attribute cryptexd's fault, then decide whether the fix is a stub, a mount change, or accepting the crash.
- Wait for the MAC refusal to reproduce and read the ip\_mac\_return value it now prints.

### 证据

- `device`: [Console enumerated as 1209:316d named QcomXnuUsbDebug; STATUS returned usb=3 er=0 with the worker polling, so the port is live in both directions.](https://github.com/FFT-infra/UniXNU-alioth/blob/695a35bd11337a27473a1ef6687977c0527b6878/docs/evidence/2026-10-27-boot-diagnostics.md)
