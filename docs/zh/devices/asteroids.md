# Nothing Phone \(3a\)（asteroids）

[rootstockos/UniXNU-asteroids](https://github.com/rootstockos/UniXNU-asteroids)

<div v-pre>

Nothing Phone \(3a\) runs the unchanged iPad7,1 iPadOS 17.7.11 image from its UFS userdata partition, with shared SM7635 support and board-owned storage, GPU, input and power integration. Bring-up runs as numbered staged tests; their results are in docs/asteroids-gpu-gen8.md and docs/asteroids-touch.md of rootstockos/iosonandng.

## 配置 {#configuration}

`implemented`

组件: `ArmDTPlatform`, `XnuPrelink`.

### 硬件与依赖

- SM7635 SoC profile \(rootstockos/UniXNU-sm7635-common\), iPadOS 17.7.11 build 21H461, asteroids\_defconfig, the board's own driver forks as submodules.

### 配置

- board.soc\_source = sm7635; board.os\_profile = ipados-17.7.11-21H461; schema\_version = 2.
- drivers/Adreno740, drivers/ShengUfs, drivers/ShengHidInput, drivers/ArmDTPlatform and kits/AdrenoFirmware are this repository's submodules at their catalog paths and take precedence over UniXNU's.

### 操作步骤

- Run ./unixnu status --json -D ../UniXNU-asteroids from rootstockos/UniXNU and review profiles, components and patch order.

### 开发经验

- Format 2 builds every selected component's kernel recipe, so \[kernel\] archives lists them as component: entries in the format 1 order; build-arm-driver.py skips Adreno740 and VirtioMmioBlock while their configuration switches are off, as format 1 never built them \(T36 run 40297420036\).
- Format 2 applies the arch, SoC and OS configuration fragments before the defconfig; bootstrap\_defconfig turns off the five options common.config adds, so both passes have their format 1 configuration \(checked with parse\_config: no differences\).
- Format 2 keeps only catalog components, so the forks of NativeAdreno and NativeUfs moved from their legacy names to drivers/Adreno740 and drivers/ShengUfs; legacy aliases are made only for UniXNU's own sources.
- T36 is the first format 2 image \(build tag T36\). Every board.toml value matches the format 1 board \(4f05a36\) except what moved to the SoC and OS profiles, the ADT tool options and the firmware pins \(proprietary-files.txt\); a dry-run pack caught kernel\_args lost in the first rewrite.
- The ADT from the shared generator matches the former make-asteroids-adt.py output except for the OS profile's additions \(J120AP first in the root compatible, product-id, /product/audio\) and the arm-io window, which now covers UFS.
- T40a \(2026-10-27\): every fork has one working branch, asteroids \(former branches are archive/\* tags\); drivers/ArmDTPlatform became the submodule fork rootstockos/ArmDTPlatform; the record check runs rootstockos/UniXNU's workflow and catalog, since UniXNU main's catalog does not know Sm7635Platform or QcomPmicRtc.
- T40c \(2026-10-27\): build tag T40; the GPU governor and fence spin are board defaults \(see gpu\).
- T40d \(2026-10-27\): sheng-lite=1 as on sheng; sheng-disable-jobs keeps only bluetoothd and coreduetd \(the lite list holds the XPC wait cycle\). The kernel from fork asteroids-dev 0d215db carries native-union-root-checkdirs.patch: the SystemOS union over / no longer leaves the OS root one usecount short \(T40c's shutdown panic in vnode\_rele\_ext\).

### 完成条件

- All source pins resolve; every selected component has a record; status shows the intended overrides and patch order.

### 当前范围

- The SoC profile is pinned to a local checkout \(local.toml\) until rootstockos/UniXNU-sm7635-common is published.

### 下一步

- Publish the SoC repository and pin its commit in feeds.toml.

### 证据

- `source`: [Format 2 board configuration with the SM7635 SoC and 21H461 OS profiles.](https://github.com/rootstockos/UniXNU-asteroids/blob/bd618af4eb9377dafaa512a07c2991c8e2469444/board.toml)

## 固件与启动 {#firmware}

`implemented`

组件: `DarwinBoot`.

### 硬件与依赖

- rootstockos/uefi-asteroids \(Mu-Silicium VolcanoPkg and asteroidsPkg\) with UniXNU, UniXNUDxe and DarwinBoot.
- The 3a's ABL loads the boot image with fastboot boot; it ignores the boot image's ramdisk.

### 配置

- \[bootimg\] payload\_in\_kernel = true: the payload rides in the kernel image and ShengBootMemoryDxe finds it in the Kernel memory region.

### 操作步骤

- Build the payload and boot image with ./unixnu build payload and ./unixnu bootimg --dtb \(the phone's live DTB\), then fastboot boot the image.

### 开发经验

- The ABL passes the vendor\_boot and init\_boot ramdisks plus bootconfig as the initrd, never the boot image's own ramdisk.
- Proprietary files follow sheng's method: proprietary-files.txt with an @fetch source and SHA-256 per file, put in .cache/firmware by scripts/extract-files.py \(which falls back to curl when Python has no CA store\).

### 完成条件

- Firmware image builds, enters UniXNU, publishes the framebuffer and preserves the documented memory reservations.

### 当前范围

- Images are booted from RAM only \(fastboot boot\); nothing is flashed.

### 下一步

- Record the firmware revision with each boot image.

### 证据

- `source`: [\[bootimg\] and \[firmware\] select uefi-asteroids and the payload in the kernel image.](https://github.com/rootstockos/UniXNU-asteroids/blob/bd618af4eb9377dafaa512a07c2991c8e2469444/board.toml)

## CPU 与中断 {#cpu}

`implemented`

组件: `ArmCpu`.

### 硬件与依赖

- Four Cortex-A520 \(cpus 0-3, EPSS domain 0\) and four Cortex-A720 \(4-6 domain 1, 7 domain 2\); EPSS domains at 17d91000/17d92000/17d93000.
- Gunyah hypervisor: SGIs are not delivered, so IPIs use armcpu-spi-ipi=1.

### 配置

- sheng-smp=1 and armcpu-spi-ipi=1 in board.toml; unixnu,cluster-type E/P in dts/asteroids.dts; sheng-cpufreq=&lt;mode&gt; selects the CPU governor.

### 操作步骤

- Boot with sheng-cpufreq=1 and the banner on, read the CPU row \(domain state and LUT\), then sheng-cpufreq=4.

### 开发经验

- The CPU governor is sheng's CpuFreqProbe with 4/3/1 CPUs per domain and no L3 vote \(the 3a has no EPSS L3\).
- The E/P Edge scheduler and the idle-time helper are sheng's zzyf and zzye patches \(patches/xnu\).
- T40c \(2026-10-27\): the cpu0 park thread is off by default \(sheng-cpu0-park=0, as UniXNU-sheng d361b53\): the E/P Edge scheduler places work by cluster, and T39b found the park thread holding cpu0 at 100 %. The governor and the AMP and idle patches already match sheng's latest.

### 完成条件

- Every enabled CPU reaches its entry checkpoint and timer/IPI handling works on each enabled CPU.

### 当前范围

- The governor and the E/P scheduler are not yet verified on the phone \(T35\).

### 下一步

- Boot T35a \(read-only\) and T35b \(governor\) and record the clocks and frame rate.

### 证据

- `source`: [EPSS CPU governor with touch boost and frame floor.](https://github.com/rootstockos/UniXNU-asteroids/blob/bd618af4eb9377dafaa512a07c2991c8e2469444/package/CpuFreqProbe.cpp)

## 内存与 DMA {#memory}

`implemented`

### 硬件与依赖

- DRAM high bank 0x8C0000000-0xABFE00000 for the XNU window; GPU pool at 0xABFE00000 \(1 GiB\); GMU pool at 0xE6440000 \(32 MiB\); all reserved in the uefi-asteroids memory map.

### 配置

- owned\_memory\_size 0x130000000 \(4.75 GiB\) and dram\_size 0x1FFE00000; the DTS memory node equals dram\_size.

### 操作步骤

- Check that payload.dram\_size equals the DTS memory node and that DarwinBoot places the window.

### 开发经验

- 384 MiB of owned memory left iPadOS short; 4.75 GiB in the high bank \(uke's layout\) is enough.
- Metal's 64 MiB blocks need a 1 GiB GPU pool outside the XNU window.

### 完成条件

- All handoff regions are accounted for and each enabled DMA engine accesses its allocated range with the documented cache policy.

### 当前范围

- The GPU and GMU pools are fixed reservations in the firmware memory map.

### 下一步

- Record the firmware memory map with each firmware change.

### 证据

- `source`: [Memory node for the XNU window's DRAM bank.](https://github.com/rootstockos/UniXNU-asteroids/blob/bd618af4eb9377dafaa512a07c2991c8e2469444/dts/asteroids.dts)

## 存储与根卷 {#storage}

`implemented`

组件: `ShengUfs`, `RamBlock`, `SoftwareAES`, `VirtioMmioBlock`, `VerifiedRoot`.

### 硬件与依赖

- UFS host 0x1d84000 and PHY 0x1d80000 \(SM8550's windows\), apps SMMU stream 0x60; userdata LUN 0 blocks 0x256248-0x3a8bffa.

### 配置

- native-ufs-root=1 and native-ufs-allow-unverified=1; sheng-data-persist=2 keeps Data at the end of userdata.

### 操作步骤

- Build the userdata image, write it to userdata from recovery, boot, and pull the Data volume with scripts/pull-asteroids-data.py.

### 开发经验

- Format 2 builds VirtioMmioBlock as ShengUfs's dependency; build-arm-driver.py skips it while XNU\_NATIVE\_VIRTIO\_BLOCK is off.
- NativeUfs \(the ShengUfs fork\) is built without the verified-root check until signed volume policies exist.
- Its IOBlockStorageDevice imports bind against the original class in a bootstrap kernel candidate built first in CI.

### 完成条件

- The root volume mounts read-only from UFS and Data persists across boots.

### 当前范围

- Root reads are not authenticated.

### 下一步

- Build the owner verified-root bundle.

### 证据

- `device`: [T29 booted iPadOS 17.7.11 from the UFS root with persistent Data to the first picture.](https://github.com/rootstockos/UniXNU-asteroids/blob/bd618af4eb9377dafaa512a07c2991c8e2469444/board.toml)
  Command: <code>fastboot boot local/unixnu-asteroids-t29-boot.img</code>. Revision: `adf900cf453a6b318864913757f588c9f661596f`.

## 显示 {#display}

`implemented`

组件: `GopFramebuffer`.

### 硬件与依赖

- The firmware's GOP framebuffer, 1080x2392 x8r8g8b8 at stride 4320, on a 120 Hz video-mode panel.

### 配置

- offline-legacy-\* arguments, sheng-vsync=120, sheng-fb-gpu=1 \(the GPU copies each frame to the panel\).

### 操作步骤

- Boot and watch the banner rows \(sheng-banner=1\) for swaps per second and copy times.

### 开发经验

- T37 \(2026-10-26\): DSI0 is reachable under Gunyah \(T37a st=1\), the brightness test ran \(T37b\), and with asteroids-panel=3 iOS sets the brightness and sleep turns the panel off and on again \(T37d\). It is a board default since then.
- T37: the panel \(Visionox RM69220 AMOLED, video mode, DSI0 at 0x0ae94000, dsi-ctrl v2.8\) takes DCS commands through the controller's TPG command FIFO, scheduled for the first front-porch line \(package/PanelProbe.cpp, asteroids-panel=1..4\): brightness 51 hi lo \(10..4095\), off 28 + 10, on 11 + 29. The iOS brightness service is sheng's AppleARMBacklight.cpp with the DCS write instead of I2C \(package/AsteroidsBacklight.cpp\); level 0 turns the panel off.
- The CPU copy \(143-285 ms a frame\) mapped the surfaces cacheable without invalidation and showed stale patches; the GPU copy removes both.
- GopFramebuffer 33e941a's direct scanout needs ShengUfs's display SMMU window \(native\_ufs\_dpu\_map\); our NativeUfs fork has none, so package/LegacyDisplayStubs.c supplies weak zero stand-ins that keep it off.
- T40c \(2026-10-27\): BootProgress.c's cpu0\_park defaults off \(see cpu\).
- T40k-T42 \(2026-10-27\): zero copy on the 3a. NativeUfs sheng-dpu-linux=1 sets the display bank up as Linux does: CBA2R and CBAR written \(the apps SMMU is qcom,virt-smmu and the hypervisor attaches the bank on that write\), TCR2 with the ASID size and SEP, cached inner-shareable walks with T0SZ 28, TTBR0 with an ASID. The bank then took stage 1 without a fault \(T40k\), where every earlier setup faulted at level 0, even with blocks lacking the access flag \(T40i-af\). T41: 1018 direct flips, 4.4 ms mean latch, once startDirect waited for the bank \(40 ms\); frames showed half drawn \(the wallpaper without the app\), so T42 flips only once the GPU's completed fence reaches the newest fence submitted at the swap.

### 完成条件

- The desktop presents through the legacy display with measured frame times.

### 当前范围

- Under 60 frames per second.

### 下一步

- Measure the frame rate with the CPU governor \(T35\).

### 证据

- `device`: [T34b: GPU copy to the panel, no tearing or stale patches, stable.](https://github.com/rootstockos/UniXNU-asteroids/blob/bd618af4eb9377dafaa512a07c2991c8e2469444/board.toml)
  Command: <code>fastboot boot local/unixnu-asteroids-t34b-boot.img</code>. Revision: `e022e84a9721ea6408ea12665b5a23e9b89fc5f6`.

## 输入 {#input}

`implemented`

组件: `ShengHidInput`, `ShengNovatekTouch`, `QcomGeniSpi`.

### 硬件与依赖

- FocalTech FT3683G on GENI SE0 SPI; PMK8550 PON power and RESIN, PMXR2230 GPIO 6 volume up, through the SPMI arbiter and PDC pin 1 \(SPI 481\).

### 配置

- asteroids-touch=6 \(package default\) and sheng-touch-hid=1; sheng-buttons=1 for the buttons.

### 操作步骤

- Boot, touch the desktop and press each button; read the BTN banner row.

### 开发经验

- Touch is polled; stage 2's RPMh votes need a completion check.
- Every button constant equals sheng's \(SPMI arbiter v7 at the same addresses, same PPIDs\).
- TouchState.cpp's placeholder button sink is gone: ButtonProbe.cpp owns native\_buttons\_set\_sink.

### 完成条件

- Contacts and buttons reach backboardd as HID events.

### 当前范围

- The buttons are not yet verified on the phone \(T35\); ShengNovatekTouch is linked as ShengHidInput's dependency and not used.

### 下一步

- Boot T35a with sheng-buttons=1.

### 证据

- `device`: [Touch input works on the desktop \(stage 6\).](https://github.com/rootstockos/UniXNU-asteroids/blob/bd618af4eb9377dafaa512a07c2991c8e2469444/package/AsteroidsTouchProbe.cpp)
  Command: <code>fastboot boot local/unixnu-asteroids-t34b-boot.img</code>. Revision: `e022e84a9721ea6408ea12665b5a23e9b89fc5f6`.

## GPU {#gpu}

`implemented`

组件: `Adreno740`, `AdrenoFirmware`, `AdrenoPM4`, `ArmSmmu4K`, `Sm7635Platform`, `Sm8550Platform`.

### 硬件与依赖

- Adreno 810 \(gen8, chip 0x44010000\) at 0x3d00000 with GMU, RSCC and SMMU; firmware gen80300 from proprietary-files.txt \(scripts/extract-files.py, the pinned NullDebris vendor repository\).

### 配置

- sheng-gpu-power=19, sheng-gpu-addon=1, sheng-gpu-level=6 \(763 MHz\); the Metal plugin and Turnip are built on the Mac into the payload addon.

### 操作步骤

- Build the kernel in CI, the addon with scripts/build-asteroids-metal-plugin.py --published, pack and boot.

### 开发经验

- NativeAdreno's GMU headers \(NativeAdrenoGmuConfig.h, NativeAdrenoGmuPlatform.h\) include ShengGmu.h, so the driver compiles also take kits/Sm7635Platform \(T36 run 40296339052\).
- The gen8 GMU cold start and command-database parser are the SoC kit Sm7635Platform \(UniXNU-sm7635-common\), as sheng's are Sm8550Platform; the board keeps ShengGmuVotes.c. scripts/check-asteroids-gmu.py passes against the kit.
- The render server composites on the A810 \(window server ready in 1.9 s instead of 30.8 s\).
- The GPU clock does not limit the frame rate: 1050 MHz was barely faster than 763 MHz.
- T40b \(2026-10-27\): drivers/Adreno740 is UniXNU Adreno740 main \(5c8c145\) merged into our gen8 fork \(rootstockos/NativeAdreno asteroids 60f16a6\): ABI v2 \(128 buffers per submission\), no full GPU TLB flush per submission, owned and exclusive imports mapped without alias scans. The board's GPU probe keeps its ABI structures and native\_adreno\_publish signature; it passes no GMU AHB fence status to the ring \(the new optional fence\_cookie/fence\_status\), so WPTR writes stay unchecked as before.
- T40c \(2026-10-27\): sheng's GPU governor is on by default in board.toml \(sheng-gpu-dcvs=1\) with the 3a's range: floor level 6 \(763 MHz, the former fixed level; sheng's floor 3 is 510 MHz here and held every frame in T39b\), ceiling level 7 \(895 MHz; no GPU thermal throttle yet\). Fence waits spin \(sheng-gpu-irq=0\) as a board default.
- T40d \(2026-10-27\): IO coherence. Nothing here set native\_adreno\_io\_coherent, so the merged driver cleaned and invalidated every imported page around every submission \(T40c log: 18 s and 361 GiB of maintenance for about 3000 submissions\). GpuPowerProbe now runs UniXNU-sheng's coherenceProbe \(08cde20\) before publishing: a kernel page mapped write-back inner-shareable, GPU reads of CPU-dirty lines and CPU reads of GPU writes both proved against DRAM; only then is it on \(sheng-gpu-coherent=0 skips it\). The driver keeps GPU-written imports non-coherent \(myron 5bbeb3b\). Turnip's 1 ms waits \(pandora 6265e2d\) were already fixed upstream \(100 ms slices in turnip-darwin-kmd.patch\); kern.maxvnodes is 66560 from upstream's iPadOS profile.

### 完成条件

- Core Animation renders through Metal on the GPU with measured frame times.

### 当前范围

- T40e: Turnip picks GMEM or system memory per pass \(TU\_DEBUG=nocb, as AdrenoMetal 461a842\); not yet booted on the 3a. Sm8550Platform is linked as Adreno740's dependency and not used.

### 下一步

- Boot T40e and compare frame rate and GPU stalls with GMEM against T40d.

### 证据

- `device`: [GPU compositing and the GPU panel copy run stable.](https://github.com/rootstockos/UniXNU-asteroids/blob/bd618af4eb9377dafaa512a07c2991c8e2469444/package/GpuPowerProbe.cpp)
  Command: <code>fastboot boot local/unixnu-asteroids-t34b-boot.img</code>. Revision: `e022e84a9721ea6408ea12665b5a23e9b89fc5f6`.

## clock {#clock}

`device-verified`

组件: `QcomPmicRtc`.

### 硬件与依赖

- The PMK8550's RTC: a read-only seconds counter behind the SPMI arbiter \(v7.1, APID 94\), described in the SoC's sm7635.dtsi.
- The Data volume for the offset file, as Android's time\_daemon keeps it under /data/vendor/time.

### 配置

- QcomPmicRtc \(UniXNU fork\) publishes IORTC with IORTCReadOnly; drivers/ArmDTPlatform \(rootstockos/ArmDTPlatform asteroids\) forwards the calendar to it as counter + offset; the kernel restores /private/var/db/unixnu-rtc-offset before launchd and stores it on every calendar set.

### 操作步骤

- Boot, set the time in Settings &gt; Date &amp; Time, restart, and compare the clock; the banner's RTC row shows the counter, restores and stores.

### 开发经验

- T39: the counter reads \(plat 3, pmic 5\); no set reached the kernel while timed hung.
- T39d/T39e: timed hung in gethostuuid\(\) without a platform UUID; with the platform seed in the ADT it answers, and a time set in Settings survives a restart.

### 完成条件

- The wall clock is right after every boot without a network.

### 当前范围

- No automatic time \(no network or GNSS time source yet\).

### 下一步

- Propose the IORTC forwarding and the RTC drivers upstream once stable.

### 证据

- `device`: [T39e: the time set in Settings survived a restart; Settings &gt; Date &amp; Time opens.](https://github.com/rootstockos/UniXNU-asteroids/blob/bd618af4eb9377dafaa512a07c2991c8e2469444/board.toml)
  Command: <code>fastboot boot local/unixnu-asteroids-t39e-boot.img</code>. Revision: `e4d1092cc3d051617ee88858b153ed2ba0d456fd`.

## 网络 {#network}

`planned`

### 硬件与依赖

- The 3a's Wi-Fi and Bluetooth module; not yet identified for a driver.

### 配置

- None yet.

### 操作步骤

- Identify the module and its bus from the live device tree.

### 开发经验

- No network driver runs; bluetoothd is disabled.

### 完成条件

- The device joins a network and passes traffic.

### 当前范围

- No network.

### 下一步

- Identify the Wi-Fi module.

### 证据

按下一步操作收集证据。

## 音频 {#audio}

`implemented`

### 硬件与依赖

- The audio DSP and its firmware; sheng's ADSP, GLINK, QRTR, GPR and AudioReach stack is the reference.
- The 3a's amplifier settings container \(vendor/firmware/tfa98xx.cnt, proprietary-files.txt\), turned into build/asteroids-tfa/AsteroidsTfaConfig.h by scripts/prepare-asteroids-tfa.py.

### 配置

- sheng-audio takes bits \(sheng-adsp=2 is required, the default\): any nonzero value serves the audio service, 2 plays a 1.5 s 750 Hz test tone at boot, 8 runs the lock sound test.
- sheng-audio-pa moves the DSP period buffer \(default 0xe6200000, the splash region's tail\); sheng-audio-tone-ms and sheng-audio-atten set the tone.
- asteroids-audio-i2s = interface \| data lines &lt;&lt; 8 \| bits &lt;&lt; 16 \(default primary MI2S, SD1, 32-bit: the amplifiers take their data on gpio17\); asteroids-audio-prm bits \(default 3\): 1 LPASS core vote, 2 MI2S bit clock request.
- asteroids-mic=&lt;stage&gt; \(default 0, with sheng-audio\) brings up the WCD9378 microphone path in stages: 1 rails \(ldob7, ldob8\) and codec reset \(gpio162\), 2 PRM votes and VA/TX core clocks, 3 LPI SoundWire pins and VA/TX macro clocks, 4 VA SoundWire master \(0x33b0000, v1.7\) and enumeration, 5 codec init \(SCP setup, io\_init, SDCA class load\), 6 capture path \(ports, micbias 1, SmartMIC0 sequencer, TX decimator 0\), 7 DSP capture graphs and a 2 s capture test, 8 capture for the plug-in. asteroids-mic-port = sample interval \| offset1 &lt;&lt; 8 \| lane &lt;&lt; 16 \(default 1 \| 1 &lt;&lt; 8\). asteroids-mic-mux=1 switches the VA macro to its own core clock \(0x3420000 = 1\) as the vendor clock manager does \(default off\).
- The GPU addon carries sheng's audio server plug-in as audio/ShengAudio.driver \(scripts/build-asteroids-metal-plugin.py builds it with scripts/build-sheng-audio-hal.py unless --no-audio, and adds its CDHash to the owner trust module\); patches/xnu/zzyd-board-audio-addon-mount.patch mounts audio/ over /System/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/HAL.

### 操作步骤

- Read the \[audio\] and \[amps\] rows: stage, DSP status, amplifiers found \(amps=3: both\), clocks stable \(lock=\), errors, SMMU result, I2C engine, PRM results \(bus= second word\), I2C failures.
- Run scripts/check-audioreach-host.py after changing the graph commands.

### 开发经验

- T38 ports sheng's audio DSP bring-up \(AdspProbe.cpp, sheng-adsp=1 survey, 2 start\) with the 3a's IPCC \(0x405000\), carveouts \(0x99300000, 0x99280000\) and crash-reason partition; the firmware comes from modem\_a \(LUN 4\) through NativeUfs's native\_ufs\_part\_find/read \(rootstockos/NativeUfs efa8271, from UniXNU's ShengUfs\).
- T41: speakers are two NXP TFA9873 \(P 0x34 slot 0, S 0x35 slot 1\) on QUPv3 wrapper 1 SE6 \(SE13, 0x898000, gpio59/60\), reset gpio141/142 \(active high\), fed by primary MI2S \(gpio15-18, function 2\) as two 32-bit slots at 48 kHz. The container carries no amplifier firmware \(a dummy patch\), only bitfield settings.
- T41: the microphone is AMIC1 of a WCD9378 \(mixer\_paths handset-mic: ADC1, MIC BIAS1 by the card routing, ADC\_LP, volume 6\) on the VA macro's SoundWire master; the handset mic back end is CODEC\_DMA-LPAIF\_RXTX-TX-3 as on sheng. The codec register recipe is the July 2026 LKML WCD9378 TX driver \(v2, paged SDCA registers, built-in power sequencers\); the master is v1.7 \(apps command FIFO at 0x31c\).
- T41: package/AsteroidsAudioProbe.cpp is sheng's AudioProbe.cpp with the 3a's board steps and the TFA9873 programs \(AsteroidsTfa9873.c\) in place of the CS35L43's; the speaker device runs 32-bit while the stream stays 16-bit \(the playback converter widens it\). The amplifiers power up after the graphs start, since they wait for the bit clock. No microphone path.
- T40k \(2026-10-27\): the speaker path ran end to end \(DSP graphs, the service, the plug-in, a 48 kHz stream without gaps; both TFA9873 rev B found, clocks and PLL locked\) but was silent: on I2S0 SD0 the amplifiers got the clocks and no data. T40k-spk-sd1 \(asteroids-audio-i2s=0x200200\) played the boot tone and iOS sound through both speakers: the amplifiers take their data on SD1 \(gpio17\), the default since T41.
- T41: TFA9873 STATUS0 bits 1, 2 and 4 \(DCOCPOK, OTDS, UVDS\) are ok flags in NXP's field list, not alarms; \[audio\] err= counts real alarms only \(OCDS, MANALARM, NOCLK, TDMERR or a missing ok flag\).
- T41, T41-mux: mic stage 4 fails. The rails are voted, the PRM grants the macro and codec votes and the VA/TX core clocks, the LPI pins and macro clocks are set \(VA SWR\_CONTROL 1\) and the master \(v1.7\) keeps its settings, but COMP\_STATUS never shows the link up, no interrupt fires and no device attaches. With asteroids-mic-mux=1 \(the VA clock source switch\) the master's registers read back 0, so the switch stays off. T42 adds \[mic extra\]: the codec reset pin read back, COMP\_STATUS over time and, with asteroids-mic-pmic=1, the codec's LDOs from the PMIC.

### 完成条件

- Playback and capture through the audio server.

### 当前范围

- The microphone does not work yet: stage 4 \(SoundWire enumeration\) fails, so the plug-in's input stream stays silent.
- The master's port timing is not taken from the vendor driver \(not in the published tree\): asteroids-mic-port tunes it.

### 下一步

- Boot T42 with asteroids-mic=4 and asteroids-mic-pmic=1 and read \[mic extra\]: whether the codec's LDOs are on and its reset is released tells whether stage 4 waits on the codec's power or on the bus.

## 电源 {#power}

`implemented`

组件: `AppleKeyStoreState`.

### 硬件与依赖

- sheng's placeholder ApplePMGR provider; the AppleKeyStore stand-in.

### 配置

- sheng-pmgr=2 \(required in board.toml by the payload check\); sheng-aks=1 publishes the AppleKeyStore stand-in with persistent Data.

### 操作步骤

- Boot and check that SpringBoard finishes booting \(AppleKeyStore opens\).

### 开发经验

- Without the AppleKeyStore stand-in on persistent Data, SpringBoard never finished booting \(T20-T28\).
- T38: sheng's battery manager client and iOS power source \(ShengBattmgr.c, ShengBattery.cpp, sheng-battery\) with the 3a's standard property numbering \(temperature 12, charge counter 14, cycles 15, design 16, full 17\); sheng's board fields \(opcode 0x50, OEM\_GET\_LOG\_BUFFER on the 3a\) and charge current are skipped.

### 完成条件

- The OS boots to the desktop with the platform power and keystore services it needs.

### 当前范围

- No battery or charging status.

### 下一步

- Port sheng's battery manager after the ADSP start.

### 证据

- `device`: [T29: with the stand-in, SpringBoard boots to the first picture.](https://github.com/rootstockos/UniXNU-asteroids/blob/bd618af4eb9377dafaa512a07c2991c8e2469444/package/KeyStoreProbe.cpp)
  Command: <code>fastboot boot local/unixnu-asteroids-t29-boot.img</code>. Revision: `adf900cf453a6b318864913757f588c9f661596f`.

## 镜像组装 {#packaging}

`implemented`

### 硬件与依赖

- The payload carries the kernel, the ADT from the shared generator, the trust caches and the GPU addon; the boot image carries the phone's live DTB.

### 配置

- \[payload\] size\_mib = 80, panic\_screen = true; the device patch series lists the fork's bring-up patches and the board CPU patches.

### 操作步骤

- ./unixnu build payload, then ./unixnu bootimg --dtb with the live DTB.

### 开发经验

- Format 2 applies only the patches its series list; the fork's bring-up patches are listed in the device series with the arch: prefix.

### 完成条件

- The boot image boots on the phone with the expected kernel arguments.

### 当前范围

- The payload is built locally in the rootstock Podman machine.

### 下一步

- Build the first format 2 kernel in CI and pack it.

### 证据

- `source`: [Board patch series after the arch, SoC and OS series.](https://github.com/rootstockos/UniXNU-asteroids/blob/bd618af4eb9377dafaa512a07c2991c8e2469444/patches/xnu/series)

## 诊断 {#diagnostics}

`implemented`

### 硬件与依赖

- sheng's boot progress kit: the live page, fault evidence, the UI trace and the banner rows.

### 配置

- sheng-log=1 keeps a persistent kernel log; sheng-banner=1 draws the rows on the desktop.

### 操作步骤

- Boot with the banner on and photograph it; pull Data for the unified log.

### 开发经验

- Never boot a test without on-screen diagnostics: T24b had none and taught nothing.
- T37 adds sheng's UFS diagnostic log \(BootLog.c, sheng-log=1\) through NativeUfs's log window \(the last 32 MiB of userdata\), with weak stand-ins \(BootLogStandins.c\) for the 104 references to probes this board does not build; scripts/pull-asteroids-log.py copies the window from recovery over adb and decodes it with sheng's read-sheng-log.py --decode. The unified log on Data cannot tell boots apart \(one boot UUID and clock base for every boot\).

### 完成条件

- Each test boot shows its stage and counters on screen.

### 当前范围

- The unified log needs a Data pull through recovery.

### 下一步

- Keep the banner rows for each new driver.

### 证据

- `source`: [Live page and banner rows.](https://github.com/rootstockos/UniXNU-asteroids/blob/bd618af4eb9377dafaa512a07c2991c8e2469444/package/BootProgress.c)
